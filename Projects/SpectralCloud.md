Below are the steps and description of the project and architecture:  
**1. Sensor:**  First the data is generated by n spectral sensors outputting 2048 float32 embeddings at a rate of 10MBPS.  

**2. IOT Device:** The sensor data is streamed directly to a non specific IOT Device  

**3. Gateway:** The data is sent from the IOT device to the cloud endpoint, it can be AWS API Gateway or a dedicated piece of software that receives the sensor input and acts as the interface of the cloud.  

**4. Ingestion:** When the data is received at the endpoint it moves directly to the ingesiton phase, Amazon Kinesis DataStreams is a stateless service that makes it easy to capture,process and store datastreams at any scale in real time,it captures data as records and retains them for a period of time which allows for reprocessing and replaying of data.

**5. Delivery:** Kinesis Firehose is a service that integrates directly with Kinesis DataStreams as a consumer,
