## What Is HPC?

HPC or High Performance Computing refers to using supercomuters to solve advanced computational problems. These machines are built with thousands or even millions of processors, massive amounts of memory, and high-speed interconnects to handle large-scale simulations, data analyses, and other tasks that require immense processing power.  

 HPC systems are designed to perform multiple computations simultaneously through parallel processing. This means breaking down a task into smaller parts and executing them concurrently, which significantly speeds up the overall computation.
 In addition to performing parallel computations,HPC systems also used distributed computing to speed up tasks,this means having multiple interconnected computers work together to perform a task,this usually is implemented in clusters.

## Why do we need it?
HPC systems are helpful in scenarios where conventional computing resources fall short,they are able to process and analyze vast amounts of information efficiently and use that analysis to solve complex problems.  
HPC systems are also helpful in areas such as weather forecasting, climate modeling, and drug discovery.
